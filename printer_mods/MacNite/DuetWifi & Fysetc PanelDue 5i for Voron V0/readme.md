# Duet Wifi and Fysetc PanelDue 5i conversion for Voron V0

These are the files I used to use a Duet Wifi and Fysetc PanelDue 5i in my Voron V0. The setup is a little bit different from the original Voron V0 design. The Duet Wifi is mounted in the back compartment. The PSU & SSR go into the bottom. I mounted the Pocketwatch extruder on the outside of the machine (for which I had to mirror the main parts and modify the mount so it does not interfere with the back panel). You'll only need the [a]_Mount_Bracket_Outside piece. The mirrored Pocketwatch parts are only mandatory if you mout the IEC Inlet on the left side (when looking from the front of the machine). If you put the IEC Inlet on the right side you can use the standard Pocketwatch.

This upload contains the following:

- parts to mount the PanelDue 5i (STL + source)
- parts of the mirrored Pocketwatch extruder (STL)
- drawing of the cutout required on the front door to fit around the LCD
- Firmware I use for the Duet Wifi
- some pictures on how I installed the Duet Wifi, SSR, PSU, Extruder and 230V inlet
- PrusaSlicer config bundle

I hope these files may help you.
